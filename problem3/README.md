## Inefficient state management

If the API call for the 'prices' state fails or takes too long, it may render with no price data.
Introduced a loading state to manage the fetching of data.

## Incorrect error handling

Changed console.err(error); to console.error(error);

## Incorrect type

blockchain: string instead of any

## Incorrect variable reference

The variable 'lhsPriority' is not defined in 'sortedBalances', it should be replaced with 'balancePriority'.

## Unnecessary re-renders

'sortedBalances' depends on both 'balances' and 'prices', but 'prices' is not used, which can lead to unnecessary re-renders when 'prices' changes.
Remove 'prices' if it is not needed.
